#### DataBase and Object
#### DataBase
- we generally need to store data in Excel Sheet
- So,Fetching the data from Excel Sheet having thousands of records are diffiuclt
- Identifying the records uniquely is difficult
- so,for all of these things we came up with a solution called database
- In which fetching the records,Updating the records, stroing the records and managing the data becomes easier
- But In Excel Sheet it is not as much as easy
- So, from file System we need to move for database because we want organised collection of data to be stored and maganed very easily
- So,In Normal database like Mysql or SQL or ORACLE the data get stored in database obviously But in the database we need to have a table which stores the information in a 
   structured format and generally a table includes two things column and rows
- Columns are basically the attributes like what kind of data we can store for every student
- Rows are basically instances of that table listout the actual information
